# Conquer-Territories
Map simulation game  

(This version is not playable)*

The game creates the map by reading an image file containing provinces with a unique color. A polygon for each province is created and every province in the image file is compared to a province in a text file containing the data for every province. Then, Another text file containing the list of countries is scanned and each province is made to belong to a single country.

To add a map: Update Maps.txt with the name of the map, the text files containing information on the countries and provinces, and the map image file (bmp). Place the three files in the Map Data folder.

*The map images used were originally created by Paradox Interactive, I have omitted them to avoid infringing on their intellectual property. Unfortunately, the game doesn't work without the image files.
